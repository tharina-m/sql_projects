# Sakila Database Queries for Customer, Staff, and Film Analysis

/*
This SQL script contains a series of queries designed to extract valuable insights from the Sakila database. The queries address multiple aspects of the system, 
including customer country origin, staff management, sales, store locations, film categories, and rental activity. Key tasks include listing unique customer countries,
 counting them, adding staff details, creating temporary tables for sales and film category analysis, and generating reports on the most popular films, actors, and
 customers with the highest rental activity. The script provides a comprehensive analysis for managing and optimizing the operations of a film rental store system.

-- 1. Write a SQL query to list the unique countries the customers come from. (Query 1)
SELECT * 
FROM country;

SELECT * 
FROM customer;

SELECT * 
FROM city;

SELECT * 
FROM address;

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM country AS co
INNER JOIN city AS ci 
ON co.country_id = ci.country_id
INNER JOIN address AS a
ON ci.city_id = a.city_id
INNER JOIN customer AS cus
ON a.address_id = cus.address_id;

-- 2. Using Question 1's query as a CTE, provide a count of unique countries the customers come from. (Query 2)

-- 3. It looks like your information has not been added to the staff table. Write queries  to add your information to the staff table with address_id = 10 
-- and store_id = 1 and to check if the table has been updated. (Query 3)

SELECT * 
FROM staff; 

INSERT INTO staff (first_name, last_name, address_id, email, store_id, active, username, password, last_update)
VALUES ('Thalia', 'France', 10,'thalia.france@gmail.com', 1, 1, 'Thalia', '8cb2237d0679ca88db6464eac60da96345513964', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

SELECT * 
FROM staff;

-- 4. Since you are the new manager, write a query that creates a column 'manager_id' after staff_id and put yourself as the manager of both stores in the store table. 
-- Check to see if that executed correctly. (Query 4)

FROM store;

SELECT * 
FROM staff;

SELECT * 
FROM payment;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE sales AS
SELECT s.store_id, CONCAT(s.first_name, ' ', s.last_name) AS full_name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_payment

-- 7. Combine the outputs of questions 5 and 6 to get the store location, full name of the employee and their total sales to the nearest dollar in descending order. (Query 7)

SELECT * 
FROM sales;

SELECT * 
FROM locations; 

SELECT s.store_id, full_name, ROUND(total_payment), store_location

-- 8. Write a query that creates a temporary table of film category (category_id and name) and average running time (to 2 decimal places). 
-- Order by shortest to longest average running time. (Query 8)

-- Include a column that shows whether the movie is longer, shorter or the same as average. 
-- Leave a 10min wiggle room i.e., mark a movie as same as average if the absolute difference between the movie duration and average category run time is less than 10 mins (average run time Â±10 mins). (Query 9)
