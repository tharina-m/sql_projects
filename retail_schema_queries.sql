/*
This SQL script contains a series of queries for analyzing various aspects of the retail database. The queries cover topics such as sales representatives,
customer orders, product performance, shipping times, and payment analysis. Specific tasks include counting sales representatives, tracking customer assignments,
identifying low-order products, checking shipping delays, and evaluating high-spending customers. The script also provides insights into sales performance,
customer credit usage, and location data across different tables in the retail schema.
